# Cloud Foundry API

## Overview

This library wraps the Cloud Foundry [command line interface](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) 
as a re-usable API. It abstracts the Cloud Controller API with API calls to CF CLI commands. It also
implements re-usable utility functions built on top of the CF CLI.
